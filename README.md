# Yeast metabolite data analysis
<br>
This repo was made as part of my 2nd Internship where I worked with metabolite MS1 and MS2 data of yeast communities processed through MZmine.
<br>
The repo contains various steps starting from data cleaning, pre-processing to comparing with outer datasets in order to identify and obtain significant metabolites for research.
