# Yeast metabolite data analysis
<br>
This repo was made as part of my 2nd Internship where I worked with metabolite MS1 and MS2 data of yeast communities processed through MZmine.
<br>
The repo contains various steps starting from data cleaning, pre-processing to comparing with outer datasets in order to identify and obtain significant metabolites for research.
<br>

<br>
Most important code are the 6x ones that perform the following fucntions:
<br>
1. Convert data from SIRIUS(a metabolite data analysis software) into dataframes;
<br>
2. Convert the data from MASSBANK (A chemical information website) into dataframes (according to our needs);
<br>
3. Compare both to identify compounds from the hits.
